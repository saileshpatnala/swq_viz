		<h1> Background </h1>

		<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p> Semantic web--an extension of the World Wide Web--was the original vision of having a structured open web. The semantic web provides a common framework that allows datasets to be shared and reused across different applications. The format used is RDF (Resource Description Framework). Starting ~6 years ago machine users outnumbered human users (e.g. web crawlers), but the data canâ€™t be exploited to its full potential because the open web is not formatted properly.
			</p>

		<h2> Motivation </h2>
			<p> UC Davis is involved in a pilot program with Cornell University and Harvard College to be the first academic libraries in the world to change their library catalog to a linked-data universe by the end of the year. </p>

		<h2> Product Summary </h2>
			<p> The web application is a proof of concept that shows how information from different linked-data sources are related to one another. We visualize this relationship using a D3.js graph. Users can use this web application to see the relationships between data found in the UC Davis Library catalog with other data found in external databases that have a SPARQL endpoints (ex: Wikipedia, Library of Congress, Online Computer Library Center). </p>
